# Web Blog
A web blog filled with placeholder text and images.

## Technology
The web blog was created with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I used Gulp for automation and NPM as package manager.

##Functionalities
I added a variety of functionalities to the web blog.

* delete comments (log in necessary)
* subscribe for the newsletter (email) *not implemented yet*
* animated pictures *not implemented yet*

I use the local storage to save and edit data. To use the admin functionalities (log in necessary) you can use this login:

## How to set up
Download the project as a ZIP-file or clone the repo. Unpack the ZIP if necessary and open index.html in a browser of your choice.
