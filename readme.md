#Web Blog
A simple web blog filled with placeholder text and images.

##Technology
The web blog was created with HTML5, CSS3 and ES6. The funcionality is simple. I used Gulp for automation and NPM as package manager.

##How to set up
Download the project as a ZIP-file or clone the repo. Unpack the ZIP if necessary and open index.html in a browser of your choice.
